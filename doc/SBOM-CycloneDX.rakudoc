=head1 ENUMS API

The C<SBOM::enums> module provides a number of functional enum values.
Note however that these are B<NOT> enums in the pure Raku sense, but
Raku classes doing the C<Enumify> role.  This to allow for an easy check
to see whether a given string is allowed for the given "enum".

=begin code :lang<raku>
use SBOM::enums;  # import *all* enum classes

say ComponentType<application>;  # ComponentType("application")
say ComponentType<foo>;          # Nil

say ComponentType{$name};
=end code

One can check for the validity of a string for the given enum class
by considering it an C<Associative>.

=begin code :lang<raku>
use SBOM::enums <DataFlow>;  # Just import DataFlow enum

say DataFlow.WHY;           # Specifies information about the...
say DataFlow<inbound>.WHY;  # Data that enters a service.

=end code

If only interested in one or more enum classes, then these can be
specified as positional arguments in the C<use> statement.  If one
wants to know what a specific enum class is about, one can call the
C<WHY> method on it, either on an enum instance (to get information
about that particular enum), or on the whole enum class (when called
on the enum type).

=begin code :lang<raku>
use SBOM::enums <DataFlow>;  # Just import DataFlow enum

say DataFlow.keys;  # (bi-directional inbound outbound unknown)
=end code

The C<keys> method can be called on the type object of an enum class
to get a sorted list of allowable strings.

=begin code :lang<raku>
use SBOM::enums <Enumify>;  # Just import Enumify role

say Enumify.keys;   # (AccessMode Acknowledgement Activity...
=end code

The C<keys> method can also be called on the underlying C<Enumify>
role to obtain a sorted list of the names of all classes of enums
available.

=head1 CREDITS

The SBOM test files in the C<t/valid> directory were taken from
L<Giuseppe Di Terlizzi's SBOM::CycloneDX repoository|https://github.com/giterlizzi/perl-SBOM-CycloneDX/>.
